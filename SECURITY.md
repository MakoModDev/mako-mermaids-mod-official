## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our mod and the servers running it seriously.

If you discover a security vulnerability (e.g., an exploit that crashes servers, allows unauthorized OP access, or corrupts data), please **DO NOT** open a public issue.

### How to report?
Instead, please report the issue privately:

1.  **Discord:** Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/8N774c8Ujd) and open a private ticket or DM a Developer/Admin directly.
2.  **GitHub Security Advisory:** If available, use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the "Security" tab of this repository.

### What happens next?
* We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.
* We will investigate the issue and keep you updated.
* Once fixed, we will release an update and credit you for the discovery (if desired).

Thank you for helping keep the Mako Mermaids community safe!
